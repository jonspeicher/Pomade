Pomade
======

This is [Pomade](https://github.com/jonspeicher/Pomade), a
[pomodoro](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com)-tracking
[Pebble](http://getpebble.com) watchapp with statistics on your wrist.

Description
-----------

Pomade is designed to allow you to practice the pomodoro technique wherever you
take your Pebble, handling the timing and sequencing of the technique
automatically. In addition, Pomade will track pomodoro statistics so that you
may measure your success and diagnose issues.

Minimum Requirements
--------------------

Pomade was built and tested with Pebble firmware v1.12.1 and version 1.2.1 of
the Pebble iOS app. It should work with version 1.9.4 of the Pebble Android
app, but I have not specifically tested it. Pomade was built with version 1.12
of the Pebble SDK.

Installation and Uninstallation
-------------------------------

Pomade can be installed and uninstalled by following the standard procedure for
your mobile phone type. See http://help.getpebble.com for more information.

Usage
-----

Pomade is designed to stay out of your way while enforcing good pomodoro
technique.

* To begin a pomodoro or a break, press the "select" button when the start icon
  (▶) is displayed in the action bar.
  
* To cancel a pomodoro or a break, press the "select" button when the cancel 
  icon (X) is displayed in the action bar. Pomade will produce two quick
  vibrations.
  
* To restart a cancelled pomodoro, press the "select" button when the restart
  icon (↺) is displayed in the action bar.

When a pomodoro or break completes, Pomade will produce a single, long
vibration and show `0:00` to indicate that the segment is complete.

Pomade won't allow you to proceed to a break if you abort your in-progress
pomodoro unless you then restart and successfully complete that pomodoro. It
will allow you to abort a break and proceed directly to the next pomodoro if
you so desire, however.

After every fourth successfully-completed pomodoro, Pomade will present a "long
break" instead of the normal break duration. This long break may be aborted to
begin the next pomodoro at any time, just like a normal break.
